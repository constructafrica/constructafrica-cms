Designers predicted that sewers would have a design life of 40 years. Little was understood about concrete sewer corrosion and nothing about their rehabilitation.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the early 1950s the problem of concrete sewer corrosion became a matter of serious concern. At an Institution of Municipal Engineer’s conference it was decided to research the problem. Together with the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), a research project to study concrete sewer corrosion was initiated.<br>&nbsp;<br>The output showed that using calcareous aggregates significantly reduced the corrosion rate. Since the mid-1960s this became the standard aggregate used for sewers. However, the significance of replacing or rehabilitating them after 40 or 50 years of use was not appreciated.<br>&nbsp;<br>The webinar on August 20th will cover the supporting services required during rehabilitation. The presenters all have years of experience in their fields of activity and have been involved with the rehabilitation of the Cape Flats outfall sewers, the largest sewer rehabilitation project undertaken in South Africa.</p>
