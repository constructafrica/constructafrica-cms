The total areal extent of Indicated Resource is 1.1 square km (with 16 million tonnes of copper indicated) at a 1.0% cut-off and 14.8 square km for the Inferred Resource (with 243 million tonnes of copper indicated) at a 1.0% cut-off. The average dip of the mineralised zone in the Mineral Resource area is 14 degrees.</p><p>The Mineral Resource estimate is based on the results from approximately 50,000 metres of drilling in 148 holes. An additional 20 holes totalling more than 2,800 metres have been completed since the closure of the database for resource estimation purposes.</p><p>The Western Forelands’ 2024 drilling program was Ivanhoe’s largest to date, with over 80,000 metres of diamond drilling completed. Drilling was predominantly focused on a potential western extension along strike of the Makoko deposit, up to the licence area boundary. Drilling was also aimed at expanding the strike of the adjacent Kitoko discovery.</p><p>Drilling confirmed the continuation of mineralisation stepping further west from the Makoko area, opening up a new area called “Makoko West”, which revealed shallow, and high-grade copper mineralisation. As a result, the strike length of the Makoko mineralised district has now increased by 20%, to over 13 km. The total strike length is comparable to that of the Kakula orebody, the main source of copper ore for the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Complex’s Phase 1 and 2 concentrators. The western edge of Kakula’s orebody is approximately 10 km from the eastern edge of the Makoko deposit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kiala</strong></p><p>Kiala, discovered in 2020, adjoins the northern boundary of the Kamoa-Kakula mining licence and is a northern extension of mineralisation from this licence along a north-trending controlling growth structure, where a sulphur-rich siltstone layer is brought progressively closer to, and eventually overlain on the aquifer. This onlapping relationship brings two key mineralising controls in contact with one another, resulting in a zone of high-grade mineralisation parallel to the growth fault.</p><p>The Kiala Mineral Resource has been defined by drilling covering an area of 0.9 square km, with 8 million tonnes of copper indicated. The average dip of the mineralised zone within the Indicated Resource is 9 degrees.</p><p>The Mineral Resource estimate is based on the results from approximately 13,000 metres of drilling in 35 holes. An additional four holes totalling more than 1,650 metres have been completed since the closure of the database for resource estimation purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","",,,,"",2023-02-28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"","published",false,false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",2025-04-03T12:04:37+00:00,2025-04-03T12:29:19+00:00,,,bb5d2495-5ee5-4952-93c2-4ff782823edb,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,Ivanhoe’s DRC exploration group is targeting Kamoa-Kakula-style copper mineralisation through a regional exploration and drilling program on its Western Forelands exploration licencesThe licences cover an area over 5 times larger than the adjacent Kamoa-Kakula Copper ComplexIvanhoe Mines is exploring for new sedimentary copper discoveries, as well as expanding and further defining its high-grade Makoko, Kiala, and Kitoko copper discoveries. Makoko,success,created

The subsoil is first known for its important phosphate and limestone resources of the Senegalese-Mauritanian sedimentary basin in operation. This basin in its coastal fringe is also rich in heavy mineral sands such as zircon and titanium. The ancient geological formations of Senegal Oriental (Birimien Socle) and the series representing the Mauritanian chain constitute an important potential for mineralisation that is still poorly recognised. They are known for their richness in precious metals, in particular gold, and base metals such as iron, copper and zinc. These formations also contain a wide variety of good quality ornamental stones (marbles, granites, serpentinites), building materials (basalt, sandstone, shells, flint, sand, clay) and other mineral substances such as manganese, tin and uranium. <em>(Source: AUDIFISC)</em></p>","",835.3,,,"100-1000",2014-06-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-30,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[""9.6 million square metres""]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"studyfeasibility","published",false,false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",2025-03-27T07:01:07+00:00,2025-03-27T11:09:06+00:00,,,cbdd4cc1-868b-4045-824f-4bcb7279c848,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,Develop Senegal as a regional mining hub in West Africa; this will be carried out through three components:,success,created

In addition, he worked with the in-house Strategic Business Development Team to enhance the design of Ville du Sport so as to generate commercial activity throughout full daily and evening cycles. Revenue generating facilities were careful integrated into the master plan of Ville du Sport during the detailed design stage of the sports venues. The resulting 310,000 square meter development fuses recreation, business, leisure, entertainment and sports training facilities within the same environment.</p><p>The urban amenities which tie the development into a cohesive urban design include a signature 10,000 square metre oval public plaza, a pedestrian retail concourse and an elevated running track. Mark generated the overall urban design concept for Ville du Sport and managed the preparation of the final allotment plans by Pujol Architectura. He also managed the preparation of the urban planning, architectural and landscape architectural design by Halcrow (Yolles) International, the master planning consultant for Tunis Sports City.</p><p><em>Source: SURF Architecture</em></p>","",5000,,,"1000-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-07-10,,2031-12-31,,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[""15,000 seats stadium "",""5,000 seats multi-purpose facility""]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"executionunderconstruction","published",false,false,false,"","","+216 71 168 000","","info@tunissportscity.com","","https://www.facebook.com/sportscitytunis/","","","","","","",2025-03-19T06:17:59+00:00,2025-04-25T14:41:04+00:00,,,84e65776-c668-4a79-9b27-33cd2711eb05,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,Sports Cities International (SCI) is developing a community centred on sport in Tunis, Tunisia.

The exploration license covers two main deposits – Galat Sufar South and Wadi Doum – and covers 1,000 square kilometres. Perseus has a 70% interest in the project, with the Government of Sudan holding a 20% stake and Meyas Nub, a local Sudanese enterprise, holding a 10% stake.</p><p><strong>GALAT SUFAR SOUTH</strong></p><p>The GSS deposit is located in the central portion of the Galat Sufar Andesite Domain. The GSS deposit is located just south of the contact between marine sediments to the north (a remnant of the Keraf sediments) and an andesitic volcanic sequence to the south. The andesitic sequence is heterogeneous comprising lava flows, pyroclastic deposits and primary volcanic breccias.</p><p>Of importance to deposit formation, the andesite sequence contains a discrete 80 to 200 metre wide volcaniclastic‐sedimentary horizon which contains dioritic sills / dykes. Mineralisation and alteration are concentrated in this unit, which is bordered to the north and south by increasingly unaltered andesitic flows and further volcaniclastics.</p><p>The host unit has been sequentially and intensely altered by the addition of albite, sericite, silica and lastly carbonate. Alteration grades from largely unaltered andesitic lavas and volcaniclastic host rocks to strongly altered and foliated silica – sericite schists in which the protolith cannot be identified. Pyrite is by far the most dominant sulphide with chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, tennantite / tetrahedrite occasionally seen in core and confirmed in petrological investigation. Gold is fine grained, typically less than 40 μm. With 95% of the gold being free gold, the remainder occurs as petzite. The gold contains ± 20% silver.</p><p>The dominant foliation at the prospect scale (S1) is pervasively developed throughout the GSS deposit area. It is sub‐vertical and strikes towards the NW (330° ‐ 340°) at moderate to high angles to the orientation of the mineralised unit.</p><p><strong>WADI DOUM (WD)</strong></p><p>The main, high-grade mineralization at WD outcrops at the base of a hill and is hosted by a strongly sulphidic volcaniclastic unit, which is in contact with a distinct rhyolite unit to the immediate east. The volcanoclastic unit dips at an angle of 20° to the southwest. This rhyolite is bounded to the east by a dacitic unit intruded by syn‐tectonic syenite / potassium altered diorite body which forms the summit of the main hill.</p><p>These lithologies are cut by thin (less than 0.75 cm), late, un‐mineralized felsic and mafic dykes. In contrast to the volcaniclastics, the rocks on the hill dip 75° to the east. Mineralization on the hill is associated with stringer zones within the syenite and in places smaller shears.</p><p>The high-grade mineralization is hosted within the volcanoclastic units which are confined by late felsic and mafic dykes. The mineralization is divided into a western volcaniclastic unit characterized by a dark colour caused by very fine-grained sulphides ( greater than 10 to 15%), which contains some of the best intercepts and a central unit of paler, sulphide rich felsic volcaniclastics which contain deformed sulphide veinlets and a lower grade footwall unit of largely un‐deformed felsic volcaniclastics. The dominant sulphide is pyrite (85% in Qemscan analysis) with the remainder comprising a mix of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and freibergite.</p><p>Alteration is confined to sericitisation within the felsic volcanics and a wider halo of carbonate alteration. Silicification is noticeably absent or weak within the high-grade part of the deposit (hence its location at the base of the hill.</p><p>The area is dominated by a strong and pervasive, north‐south trending schistosity, which is largely followed by the late dykes. The high-grade mineralization often appears un‐affected by structure, whereas the mineralization hosted by the syenite on and around the summit of the hill does appear structurally controlled.</p><p><em>Source: Perseus Mining</em><br>&nbsp;</p>","",,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"studyfeasibility","published",false,false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",2025-03-01T14:01:13+00:00,2025-03-01T14:07:10+00:00,,,,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,The Meyas Sand Gold Project sits on the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS), close to Sudan’s northern border near Egypt, around 900 kilometres north of the capital Khartoum.

On the basis of a multi-criterio analysis between the different alternatives studied, it was already concluded in the mid-1990s that the two most feasible solutions were the suspended bridge on fixed supports and the excavated tunnel.</p><p>Given the topographic configuration of the area of the Straits of Gibraltar, there were 2 possible routes: to the East the Canyon Route between Punta Canales and Punta Cires with a distance between banks of only 14 km and depths greater than 800 m, and to the West, the Threshold Route between Punta Paloma and Punta Malabata, with a maritime route of 28 km and with maximum depths of around 300 m.</p><p><strong>Bridge Solution</strong></p><p>In relation to the bridge option, the possible solutions for each of the routes were evaluated. Thus, at the end of the second stage of studies in 1996, a primary preliminary project APP95 was obtained with the Bridge 14 solution, in reference to the route by the Canyon Route, the Bridge 28 solution, in reference to the route by the Threshold Route.</p><p>Bridge 14 would be composed of two large central spounds of 5,000 m, and two other side spounds of 1,800 m each. The maximum foundation depth would be 480 m, and the maximum pile height would be more than 1,100 m. This alternative was discarded due to the extraordinary dimensions, very far from what is executed worldwide.</p><p>Bridge 28 would be composed of three large central spases of 3,550 m, and two other side sides of 1,500 m each, which would be linked to a north approach viaduct of 7,475 m and another south viaduct of 6,275 m. The maximum foundation depth would be 315 m, and the maximum pile height would be around 800 m. The cross section would be composed of 4 road lanes, two in each direction. The possibility of incorporating two railway tracks centered on the dashboard was also analyzed.</p><p><strong>Tunnel solution</strong></p><p>Regarding the tunnel option, the only possible route is proposed through the shallower route, that is, by the Threshold Route, and would be designed for railway circulation. The distance between terminals would be 42 km, with 38.5 km in tunnel of which 28 km would be under the sea. The cross section of the tunnel would be provided in two parallel single-track tubes with a service / security gallery centered between them, and transverse connection galleries every 340 m. The tunnel would be designed for both conventional and high-speed train traffic, in addition to shuttles for the transport of light and heavy vehicles between the two terminals located on the respective banks. This operating model would be similar to that of the Eurotunnel.</p><p><strong>Description of the railway tunnel base solution</strong></p><p>The excavated tunnel base solution provides for the union of the Moroccan terminal located in Tangier and the Spanish terminal located near Punta Paloma. The composition of the main works is shown in the diagrams below and would consist of two railway tunnels with a single track and circular section of 7.90 m inner diameter, a service / security gallery of 6 m in diameter centered between the two, and transverse galleries every 340 m, with a diameter each of them of 6 m.</p><p>From the point of view of security, the execution of a Safe Parking Zone (ZAS) is planned at the lowest point of the tunnel, which would be provided with stop areas in the railway tunnels, security areas and intervention areas, as well as a smoke extraction gallery. This gallery, which would be made primarily to investigate the land to be crossed, in particular those that fill the paleochannels, would serve as an access route to the ZAS during the execution of the works, and finally would be used for the evacuation of fumes in the exploitation phase of the infrastructure.</p><p>The geological discoveries (bioclastic sands and the paleochannels filled with gaps) during the campaigns carried out during the stage from 1996-2005, gave rise, among other modifications, to a new primary preliminary project in 2007 (APP07), in which these new findings were incorporated. From this document, it is worth highlighting an adaptation of the layout in the plant, a general decrease in the tunnel level, the reconsideration of the geological model, as well as the multiparametric analysis on the geomechanical behavior of the gaps, the revision of the design of the terminals, safety, facilities and railway equipment.</p><p><strong>Planned cross-section</strong></p><ul><li>Two single-track railway galleries of 7.9 m inner diameter.</li><li>A pressurized service/security gallery, 6.0 m in diameter, centered between both railway galleries and communicating with them through transverse passages at regular intervals (every 340 m).</li></ul><p>As for the operation, the APP95 had planned a first phase of operation in monotube, that is, on a single railway track in which it would circulate in both directions, connected to a smaller diameter service gallery that would solve the problems of maintenance and safety of the work, while a second railway tunnel was built according to demand.</p><p>However, recent studies have shown that traffic demand, according to forecast models, does not recommend phased execution, and it will be more profitable to build the project in its final configuration, that is, with the two railway tubes. On the other hand, the large projects of base tunnels in Europe executed in recent years, are setting a trend with a configuration of only two railway tunnels, without service/security tunnels between them. This variant would reduce the cost and maintain an acceptable level of security.</p>","",20000,,,"1000-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"conceptplanning","published",false,false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",2025-02-25T08:50:05+00:00,2025-03-13T06:13:23+00:00,,,,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,Also known as Spain-Morocco Undersea Rail Tunnel Project. Project alternativesThe different options analyzed were suspended bridge on fixed supports, suspended bridge on floating supports, submerged tunnel supported on the seabed, submerged floating tunnel and excavated tunnel.

The city will be developed as a public private partnership, in which the Government will take a minimal role, developing the public infrastructure and regulatory guidelines.</p><p>Konza is planned as a mixed-use, high density walkable city that accommodates a diversity of programmes and districts. By avoiding superblocks and auto-orientated roadways, Konza aims to be a livable, sustainable urban environment that encourages high-value development and discourages sprawl. Planning will take cues from successful global urban centers, yet be specific to the needs of Kenya and the region.</p><p>An integrated urban ICT network will support delivery of connected urban services and allow for efficient management of those services on a large scale. Specifically, a smart city framework will integrate infrastructure services (transportation, utilities, public safety, environment); citizen services (access and participation); city services (city information, planning and development), and business services (supportive services for local commerce).</p><p>As a smart city, Konza will gather data from smart devices and sensors embedded in the urban environment, such as roadways, buildings, and other assets. Collected data will be shared via a smart communications system and be analyzed by software that delivers valuable information and digitally enhanced services to Konza’s population. For example, roadway sensors will be able to monitor pedestrian and automobile traffic, and adjust traffic light timing accordingly to optimize traffic flows.</p><p>The master plan includes a university, a residential area, science and tech area, and an office band. The intersection of these zones create vivid connections and become points of interest that seed neighbourhoods of distinct character. The stitch master plan also contains a series of neighbourhood parks, located throughout the city with varied orientations. Most parks are connected to the green boulevard, a 60 meter parkscape and public transit corridor.</p><p><em>Source: International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation</em></p>","",800,,,"100-1000",2024-06-03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2027-12-31,,,,,,,"","","","<iframe src=""https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d510475.9721716137!2d37.74584770202637!3d-1.684785230136972!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x182f8d9cdee5823d%3A0x830cb380d272a21b!2sKonza%20Technopolis%20Site!5e0!3m2!1sar!2sae!4v1743937869746!5m2!1sar!2sae"" width=""600"" height=""450"" style=""border:0;"" allowfullscreen loading=""lazy"" referrerpolicy=""no-referrer-when-downgrade""></iframe>",,,"[]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"executionunderconstruction","published",false,false,false,"","","+254 11 112 1100","","konza@konza.go.ke","https://konza.go.ke","","","","","","","",2025-02-20T05:16:44+00:00,2025-04-06T11:11:27+00:00,,,7c273a5e-4542-4fa0-9cf5-5df5629bed63,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,In 2009, The Konza Technopolis project was initiated with the procurement of a 5,000 acre parcel of land at Malili Ranch, 60km south east of Nairobi along Mombasa-Nairobi A109 road.

Located in Morocco’s renewable energy rich region of Guelmim Oued Noun, it will cover an approximate area of 1,500km2 and will be connected exclusively to Great Britain via 3,800km HVDC sub-sea cables.<br><br>This “first of a kind” project will generate 10.5GW of zero carbon electricity from the sun and wind to deliver 3.6GW of reliable energy for an average of 20+ hours a day. This is enough to provide low-cost, clean power to over 7 million British homes by 2030. Once complete, the project will be capable of supplying 8 percent of Great Britain’s electricity needs.<br><br>Alongside the consistent output from its solar panels and wind turbines, an onsite 20GWh/5GW battery facility provide sufficient storage to reliably deliver each and every day, a dedicated, near-constant source of flexible and predictable clean energy for Britain, designed to complement the renewable energy already generated across the UK.<br><br>Four cables, each 3,800km long form the twin 1.8GW HVDC subsea cable systems that will follow the shallow water route from the Moroccan site to a grid location in Great Britain, passing Spain, Portugal, and France.<br><br><strong>Generation</strong><br><br>The Morocco-UK Power Project will be powered by a wind and solar farm, approximately 1,500km2 in size, within Morocco’s Guelmim Oued Noun region. The wind farm will utilise the reliable Trade Winds in the region, which are driven by the temperature differential between the Atlantic Ocean and African continent. The windspeed at the generation site increases throughout the late afternoon and evening, ensuring power can be delivered to Britain during times of peak demand.<br><br>The solar photovoltaic (PV) farm will cover approximately 200km2 and track the sun from east to west throughout the day. This will not only maximise the output of the solar farm, but it will also increase the output early in the morning and late in the afternoon, providing the most consistent generation profile to Britain. Although the project will benefit from the most advanced solar panel designs, they will work in the same way as the ones installed on people’s houses, throughout the UK, and existing generation sites within Morocco. However, the increased solar resource means that the same PV panels generate approximately three times more power in Morocco than they would in the UK. Importantly, the solar panels will generate as much as five times more power from January to March than those in the UK, which will help to keep the lights on and homes warm in Britain throughout the coldest winter days.<br><br><strong>Storage</strong><br><br>The project will benefit from a 20GWh/5GW battery facility, which will provide confidence that the power generated can be stored and delivered to Britain at the times when it is most needed. This will primarily be provided by Lithium-ion batteries like those used in electric cars, home battery systems and utility scale storage projects throughout the world.<br><br>These batteries will also allow Xlinks to install more solar PV systems and wind generation, which will maximise the use of the subsea transmission system. Delivering an average of 20+ hours a day at full power reduces the cost of sending per unit of electricity delivered to Britain. It also provides National Grid with the confidence that the project will be powering Britain even at times of low wind and low solar output across Northern Europe.<br><br><strong>HVDC System</strong><br><br>To allow for electricity transfer, Xlinks is also installing a transmission system from the generation site in Morocco to Britain, most of it across the ocean. The power generated will be transmitted directly to Britain without connection to the Moroccan, Spanish, Portuguese, or French transmission networks. This provides confidence that no matter what is happening on any electricity networks, Britain will have exclusive access to reliable power from the Moroccan wind and solar resources.<br><br>The transmission system will use High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) cables to send the power from Morocco to Britain. HVDC technology is now well tried and tested as reliable and more cost competitive for a large volume of electron transfer across longer distances, than the High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) technology typically used for transmission systems within countries.<br><br>Converter stations will be used to change the HVAC power at the generation site in Morocco to HVDC, which is then sent through the subsea cable with very low losses before another converter station in Britain changes the HVDC power back to HVAC, ready to be injected into the British transmission network. While the Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project subsea cable is significantly longer than existing interconnectors, the HVDC technology is the same proven technology used for connecting Britain and other European countries, or the technology proposed for the interconnector between Morocco and Portugal.<br><br><em>Xlinks</em></p>","",22000,,,"1000-",,,,,,,,,2022-03-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","","","",,,"[]",,"[]",,,,,,,"[]","[]","[]","[]","[]",,"design","published",false,false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",2025-02-02T05:11:22+00:00,2025-02-02T05:22:44+00:00,,,,Construction Projects Africa ConstructAfrica,The Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project will be a new electricity generation facility entirely powered by solar and wind energy combined with a battery storage facility.
